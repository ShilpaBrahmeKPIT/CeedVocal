To build CeedVocal Demo, you need to setup the following:

- Add the provided static library (libCeedVocal-universal.a) to your Xcode project and app target
- Add the provided acoustic models to your app target as resources
- Insert the license code that we have provided to you
- Check that the bundle ID of the project matches the one for which we generated the license code.
- Build you project

If the license code you have received is an evaluation code, the application will display an alert view when it starts. You won't get the alert view if you obtained a deployment license.
